class SubclassTemplate(RecurrentWhisperer):
    ''' Template for subclassing RecurrentWhisperer. Everything here is copied
    from RecurrentWhisperer.py, but includes only the minimal set of functions
    that must be implemented by any RecurrentWhisperer subclass.

    Technically, the following functions are not required in all use cases, but
    are included here for completeness:

    Required only if generating (or augmenting) data on-the-fly during
    training:
        generate_data(...)

    Required only if do_batch_predictions:
        _combine_prediction_batches(...)

    Not required, but can provide additional helpful functionality:
        _setup_training(...)
        _update_valid_tensorboard_summaries(...)
        _update_visualizations(...)

        hyperparameters that are hashed to define a directory structure for

        different hyperparameter settings). These hyperparameters may affect
        the model architecture or the trajectory of fitting, and as such are
        typically  swept during hyperparameter optimization.
